            <p>I just don’t know where to start.”

                “I want my space to feel new, <br> but I want it to feel like me <br> and not go out of style next year.”
                
                “I need the help, but I have no idea how to work with a design consultant.”
                
                <br> We can hear you. We do in fact hear this a lot. And for precisely this reason, each of our locations is staffed with knowledgeable design advisers who are standing by to lead you through the vast world of possible fashion choices.

                We commend you for your intelligence, foresight, and teamwork, which is even better. There is no charge! For as long (or as little) as you require to achieve your goals. Exactly what? We might even develop a friendship along the road. (It might be YOU saying, "My designer friend suggested this; don't you adore it?!")

                Why use a design expert? 
                If you look at how we all manage the rest of our life’s complexities, using a design consultant makes sense.

            <h3>Here are furniture layout ideas for small homes/apartments</h3>
            <p>Have you ever wished you could simply click the "Refresh" button to update your room? It's not just you! Continue reading for 4 advice on using accents and accessories to swiftly transform any environment. Here, we'll break down all the crucial stages to choosing and styling cushions, rugs, lighting, window treatments, wall art, mirrors, and more using what we learnt through consulting our designers, polling our stylists, and perusing our showroom archives.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 1.Swap out your pillows—and add a cozy throw! Accent pillows, throw pillows and a gorgeous throw can make all the difference. Bassett has a wide range of pillow shapes and sizes, each can be tailored with hundreds of fabrics in a variety of colors, patterns, and textures.
               <br> 2.Use an area rug to define your space. <br> The right rug can set boundaries for a room or sitting area, <br> it can even establish the color scheme for your whole home. A solid or patterned area rug can accent different design styles, furniture choices, and wall color. <br> Rugs inspire us to experiment with a variety of new color palettes. <br> Textures and ornate patterns add visual interest and work with other décor elements to create a unique and interesting look. <br> Look for a medium pile or shag, machine woven, or one that’s hand tufted.</p>
               <br>
               <p> 3.Window treatments help to define your space. Window coverings, <br> whether they are custom or not, are crucial for a variety of reasons, <br> including framing a breathtaking view, hiding a less-than-stellar perspective, filtering or blocking sunlight, ensuring privacy, enhancing acoustics, or simply providing energy-efficient insulation. Every tale has a backdrop created by window treatments. <br> They soften the geometric rectangles of windows, giving them a cozier appearance.</p>
               <br>
               <p> 4.Add depth with mirrors. Decorative mirrors have a way of adding a magical quality to every room. <br> And who doesn’t love how they refract light around your living space? <br> Refined and adaptable, mirrors redefine a room's spatial boundaries. A well-chosen floor mirror can give a room some deserving character and sophistication all its own. Mirrors have a way of making smaller rooms feel larger. <br> They work perfectly in living rooms, bedrooms, family rooms, and foyers. <br> In smaller rooms, wall mirrors can dress up a space while adding depth and character. Even a small dining room benefits from a horizontal wall mirror reflecting simple candlelight or a sparkling chandelier.
